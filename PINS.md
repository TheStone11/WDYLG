# JOKERS

## (The) Ceaseless Void

Hailing from the "World Famous" Terraria mod "**Calamity**", this joker is probably **NOT DOWNPLAYED FROM IT'S ORIGIN.**
While in your joker slots: it passively destroys scored bonus and foil cards, stealing the scored chips for power.

Highlighting the joker and pressing G while in a booster pack triggers *Ceaseless Hunger*, giving you the entire pack for free and turning excess cards **Negative**.

Doing the same before the hand enables ceaseless void to unleash it's stored power, boosting your chips.

**HOWEVER** if you EVER sell this joker or get it destroyed by any other means, half of your deck will be Taken along as collateral damage.

## THE LEGENDARY ARTIFACT.

BEHOLD, THE ULTIMATE GLASS CANNON... 
although on average, only one in every four artifacts are real.. the rest instantly summon mad sackboy.

## MAD SACKBOY.

Trying to score this joker causes a coinflip between giving fake exponential mult that compounds on itself, or instantly deleting love.

## bigrat.monster

This big rat turns stone to XCHIPS and RETRIGGERS and gives it to the final joker in your slots, or sends it directly to the last playing card...
whichever comes first.

Counts as part of the Danger archetype if joyous spring is enabled.

# Consumables

## NighMortem Neutron Star.

Aka. "Dying Neutron Star"

Trades all your enhanced cards, jokers, and levels for levels on a hand determined the moment the card generates.

# BLINDS

## Supreme Defenestration.

Basically this thing is a unholy fusion between a blind i have never tested (which i only used lovely patcher for) and a blind which grows stronger with every discard.
The formula is X^Y where X is 4 + the total nominal of all discarded cards and Y is the total multiplier of all loaded blinds in the curren t session
Discarded cards have a 4/5 chance of turning into glass PER TURN, and cards which are already glass turn cards with the same nominal in hand to glass.
Upon playing, all glass cards have a chance of shattering.. played or not.

Disabling the blind does not stop the initial scaling.

## The Undone.

Lovingly known as tabula rasa.
cards can only have unmodded editions, modded jokers are debuffed, modded editions held in hand add a coutner which kills when it hits three.
**TRYING TO ONE SHOT THE BLIND WILL FORCE MODDED CARDS TO PERMANENTLY STAY DEBUFFED**
